# Uber Supply-Demand Gap - Case Study_by Ankit Uikey
## Introduction: 
"Uber's ride request system is a complex operation involving thousands of requests each day. However, the company faces significant challenges that affect both customer experience and revenue."
In this case study, we have a masked dataset which is similar to what data analysts at Uber handle. By solving this case study, we will get an idea about how problems are systematically solved using EDA and Data Visualization.

## Problem Statement
As a data analyst, we need to address the problem Uber is facing - i.e. driver cancellation and non-availability of cars, leading to loss of potential revenue.
If drivers cancel the request of riders or if cars are unavailable, Uber loses out on its revenue.

Our task is to present the problem, the analysis and the recommendations using plots to the Chief Data Scientist in a well-formatted presentation.
